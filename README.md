This is a RESTful API for managing notes. The API has been written in Javascript in Node.Js runtime environment using express framework and a few more npm modules. It has a endpoints for:

1. Creating notes (with file attachments also) and reminders.
2. Fetching all notes inside our database.
3. Fetching notes from database of a particular ID.
4. Responding to a search query with notes corresponding to search query paramaeter.
5. Updating a note.
6. Deleting a note.


Apart from all the endpoints mentioned above, this API has a feature which can send a reminder notification to the user on time when user has set a reminder with the description of the reminder. But, that feature requires to consume another API and due to that limitation that function is not yet completely written.
